# Let's ~~Cheat~~ Continue

In this code, I used the 'continue' command to stop executing code in the loop and start at the top of the loop again.
Also, I used the 'exit()' command to stop completely the program and it will not run any more lines of code.

I reedited the code from day 14 'Rock, Paper and Scissors', putting the if..elif..else conditions inside loop 'While True', making it stops with 'exit()' when the players scores were equal 3.
