# Send it Back

The challenge was about the 'return command' to send some information back to the part of the code that called it.

## 👉 Day 25 Challenge
Let's extend Day 24's project and create a health stats generator for a character in a video game.

- Create a subroutine that rolls a dice of any size and returns that number.
- Then, create a second subroutine that rolls one six-sided dice and one eight-sided dice.
- Multiply the number from the six-sided dice and eight-sided dice together and return that subroutine as a character's health stats for a video game.
- Print out the character's health stats.
- Add a loop to give the user the option to generate health stats for another character.
