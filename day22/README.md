# Use other people's code

This challenge, I had to import the random library. I already had used it on challenge 18, so I did it again, but chanced the level and make it hard. Also, at the end of chances, the user will not know the correct number.

### Used:
- random library
- while True/break/exit()
- range function
- if/elif/else conditions
- print()
