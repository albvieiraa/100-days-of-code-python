# Guess the Number

As the title suggest, the user has to guess a random number.
For this challenge, I choose to import 'random' and use a range 1 to 100.
Also, I added some conditions:
* The user has 5 attempts to guesse the rigth number
* If the user enters a number smaller than the range, he/she will have another chance - instead of exit the game.
