# Roll in the Parameters

Using arguments to get subroutines more funcitonals.
Oh this Day 24th, I needed to do:
- Create subroutines that will roll a dice with any number of sides (essentially as big of a number as you like). Write one subroutine with one parameter that allows us to call a function (such as rollDice).

### Used:
- random library
- while true / break
- def function()
- print()
